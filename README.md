# A Luxurious Hero Section for Sophisticated Brands

To sum it up a series of bokehs (the little orbs) are rendered on the screen in a randomized shade of either pink or blue 

Each bokeh is responsive to the user's finger or mouse in a way where they move around and grow and shrink in size as you interact with it.

Any text you enter changes alignment depending on the user's screen size and animates a blur effect with a randomized delay.

It looks very luxurious and fancy, perfect for websites that want to represent their brand in such a manner. The section can be full-width or half-width.

## How can this design improve? 
I definitely need to figure out a way for users with slower devices to be able to enjoy the animation without it lagging. It is more CPU intensive than I would like, that is for sure. 

But it handles decently on my $200 Chromebook, so I don't think it's TOO big of an issue.

Of course, the entire thing could easily be replaced with an animated webm video for slower devices but that loses the wow factor of being able to interact with the design in real-time!
